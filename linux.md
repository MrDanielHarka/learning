# Linux

## Notes

The installation was pretty straightforward. My older PC seems to run Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS without any issues. I installed VSCode and GitHub Desktop. The OS seems fine, but I don't like how I lose screen real estate due to the "useless" top bar. I prefer the Windows way of doing it, where all the programs, the date and the volume was at the same place. At least I could set the docker to auto.hide, so it's something.
